# Quick start
In each folder, you can run `bash run.sh` to quickly start the experiment. We use the small dataset `../data/data.pcap` to do these experiments in this project. If you want to use other datasets, you need to modify the path in the `.cpp` files and check whether the file reading method is correct.  

The number at the beginning of the folder name indicates the section in the paper where the experiment is described. For example, `5.2_Frequency_Estimation` indicates that the experiments on frequency estimation is in Section 5.2.
