# About the Dataset
Here, we provide a small dataset extracted from the CAIDA dataset. For the full CAIDA datasets, please register in [CAIDA](https://www.caida.org/) first, and then apply for the datasets. The CAIDA dataset is a data stream of anonymized IP trace collected in 2019. In our evaluation, we use Ipv4 Source IP address as the item ID and count item frequency.

**Notification:** The dataset in this folder is only used for testing the performance of SeiveSketch and the related sketches in this project. Please do not use this dataset for other purpose.
